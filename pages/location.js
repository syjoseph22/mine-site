          The Company has completed and delivered <strong>Plan De Desarrollo Minero (PDM)</strong> to ARCOM.
          ARCOM is the Mining Regulation and Control Agency responsible for granting and managing mining licences in Ecuador.
        </p>
        <p>
          VOHO has a <strong>two-staged plan</strong> moving into production.
          Firstly, as the gold is on the surface with minimal overburden stripping needed,
          after the construction of the initial Pilot Plant we shall construct further Small Scale Pilot Plants to generate immediate cash flow and gain a better understanding of the resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our second stage shall involve the construction of a <strong>large-scale processing plant</strong> to increase production.
          VOHO‚Äôs strategy will allow it to be substantially self-funding and not dependent on shareholders for additional funding.

          Sabaleta test pitting to date is generally to a depth of six metres,
          and the current gold resources are based on this depth in an area covering approximately one third of the gold-mineralised terraces within the concession.
        </p>
        <p>
          The terrace profile is up to <strong>200 metres deep</strong>.
          Therefore, the total volume of gold-mineralised ore may be well in excess of <strong>one billion cubic metres</strong>,
          with potential for <strong>10 million ounces of gold</strong> in the concession.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exploration phase at Sabaleta has been successful in revealing several blocks of alluvial resources along the Valley of Camunbi River.
          The grade and volume indicate that mining of the deposit at today's gold price is highly viable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further potential resources have been uncovered downstream from Sabaleta camp,
          which could <strong>double the present resource volume</strong>.
          Overburden depth remains manageable with a total section grade cut-off of <strong>0.15 g/m¬≥</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing revealed consistent data with characteristic <strong>nugget gold</strong> present throughout the alluvials.

          <strong>Michel Rowland</strong>, Independent Technical Consultant, has provided a <strong>JORC Code</strong>-compliant technical report.
          This includes resource calculations and recommendations for the ongoing exploration program.
        </p>
        <p>
          To date, the resource results for the <strong>North and South Concession Areas</strong> (illustrated in the map)
          to a depth of 6 metres cover <strong>1,106 hectares</strong> and <strong>911 hectares</strong> respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a reasonable expectation that ounces in the inferred category may be elevated to Measured or Indicated status through further pitting.
